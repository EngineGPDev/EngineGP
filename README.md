## About The Project

EngineGP is an open source control panel that provides the ability to manage and rent out game servers. EngineGP was written between 2010 and 2015 (Evaluated by coding style) by Valery Marchenko. The original EngineGP did not include licensing and was passed from hand to hand. In 2018, the author of the source code disappeared and the source code was picked up by the Open Source community and began to be promoted under the MIT license
